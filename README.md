1. There is a file named audio.mid which is the goal file.
2. When you clone the repo. Add junit 4 beta jar file.
3. Now click on Main.java and run the file. 
4.You will be getting the original Individual genotypes.
5.The program performs fitness functions and generate final song in Original Sounds
6. All the intermidiate sounds are in Saved Sounds.
